# Advent of Code 2022


This repo contains the code of my personal approach for solving the  [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/) puzzles.
You can run this Java code and see the solutions of the resp. day in the console.

You can run the app with the standard configuration (all available days will be solved) in intelliJ. Just select "AdventOfCode" from the run configurations and start the app.

The config file is located in
`.idea/runConfigurations/AdventOfCodeApp.xml`
